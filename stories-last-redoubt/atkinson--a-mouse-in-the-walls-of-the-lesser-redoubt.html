            <p>The Fixed Giants huddled under the glowing blue veil. Literally mountainous, their sluggish sentience rarely demanded movement. Sometimes, when the burning blue mist thinned, they would slump down a little. Days and millennia passed, but they never relaxed their scrutiny of the mile-high metal pyramid a hundred miles to the East.</p>
            <p>On one otherwise unremarkable day, they watched as a flood of fire washed down the pyramid, incinerating a dozen beasts that had ventured too close and sending hundreds more fleeing for their lives. Before the liquid fire died away, a small door opened at the base of the pyramid, and a group of children stepped into the Night.</p>
            <p>The children wept as armour-clad men stepped back inside the Lesser Redoubt. The last man in line hesitated, silhouetted in the splinter of light. He raised his Discos in a bleak salute; it flared for an instant, then he was gone. The dark returned, and a chattering, cacophony rose from its emboldened inhabitants. Beasts crawled, slithered and crashed among the sea of rubble that surrounded the pyramid. Most of the children cried and hugged each other. Alone among them, a young girl twisted a motley-coloured cloth in her hands, and waited patiently.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The pyramid stood at the top of a half-mile high hill. Three vertical beams of light marked its corners, and a ring of fused rock surrounded its base. This marked the limit of the ambitions of most of the creatures of the Night. Once in a while, a newly spawned beast, or one driven mad by frustration, would launch itself at the Redoubt. Infrequently, entire clans of beasts would attack the Redoubt, often using the bodies of their fallen kin to breach the Ring of Fire. At these times, malevolent liquid fireballs rolled down the pyramid’s sides with deadly accuracy, killing most of the attackers. The few that made it to the apex found the Prefects with their Diskoi spitting electric fire waiting for them. The defence had held for eight million years, and the defenders saw no reason to believe that it would ever fail.</p>
            <p>At the Lesser Redoubt’s apex, two men watched the tragedy below. The well-used machinery of defence was scattered around, and watchers were bent over telescopes, alert for danger. They stood on a narrow gantry welded to the inner skin of the metal pyramid and looked out through wide loopholes. The gantry was open to the elements and a thin chill wind was blowing.</p>
            <p>“You do not have to do this, my lord,” the older of the two men said. He was huddled inside a thick cloak that was slowly gaining a speckling of flecks of air snow. The other man was wearing a heavy samite gown, interwoven with strands of gold and silver.</p>
            <p>“It has been my duty to watch this thing for the last ten years, Lord Gallowglass,” the other man said. “The burden has not yet fallen on another’s shoulders.”</p>
            <p>“It will soon enough, my lord.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe.”</p>
            <p>“You have passed the first three hundred and twenty-five tests, old friend, surely this last one cannot be so hard?”</p>
            <p>“The enKernelling? I understand it is . . . hard. Will you guard the door for me?”</p>
            <p>“Of course, my lord. The Moramor and I will stand sentry.”</p>
            <p>“Good. Your love will help keep me safe -- from whatever awaits me.”</p>
            <p>They fell silent, and looked out into the Night Land. To the North the sky was tinged with a dull red light, and a faint blue glow painted the Western horizon. The rest of the world was lost to darkness. The Master Monstruwacan-designate leaned forward and looked down at the broken land. In the eternal gloom it was difficult to make out details, but things were moving amid the rubble -- and the children were gone.</p>
            <p>“It is done,” the Gallowglass said quietly. “You should go back inside.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” the Master-designate said reluctantly.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>“No good will come of this!” Essa said, brandishing the Hour-Slip.</p>
            <p>“Be still, wife. If the council has decided to elect that young fella Master what’s-his-name, there’s nothing you or I can do about it,” Hugh Leverhede replied, secretly cursing the Hour Criers Guild. They were an unpredictable bunch at best, and one never knew when the next bunch of Hour-Slips would filter down from them. Sometimes months went past without any news. That suited Hugh: ‘no news ain’t bad news’ was his motto, and the Crier’s sudden burst of efficiency was unwelcome.</p>
            <p>“Pass the honey, please.”</p>
            <p>Essa ignored him. “It says here that’s he’s only thirty-eight years old. Imagine that.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think I can, sweet pea,” Hugh said, feeling a sudden arthritic twinge in his back. “Pass the honey, please.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t you sweet pea me,” Essa said as she gave the pot a shove in his general direction. “Oh preserve us!”</p>
            <p>“Now what?” Hugh asked as he spooned black honey onto his mushroom bread.</p>
            <p>“His wife just died, poor thing, and he’s been left with a little baby daughter. Who’s going to look after the little mite while he’s off running the Redoubt?”</p>
            <p>“I imagine that —”</p>
            <p>“They say that he’s the first Master Monstruwacan whose grandchildren didn’t have grandchildren of their own. Makes you wonder they elected someone so young.”</p>
            <p>“Not me it doesn’t. In any case, he’s only the Master-designate. He might fail the trials.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I suppose so,” Essa said, a little mollified at the prospect. “Don’t you have to be off soon? I thought you had a long trip today.”</p>
            <p>“Aye, all the way down to the Earth Current generator. Seems they’ve got some corrosion in one of the turbines. Nothing my little friends can’t fix.”</p>
            <p>“I swear you think more of those things than you do of me.”</p>
            <p>“Now don’t be daft, wife. No Jackotrade colony could take the place of a warm woman on a cold night — better than a hot water bottle!”</p>
            <p>“Hmm,” she said with a smile. “Get away with you, you old rascal.”</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>As he waited to be called, the Master-designate opened a small locket. Inside were two miniatures painted in vivid enamels on translucent bone china; one was of his baby daughter, Naani, and the other his wife. He touched her image. It was strange, only six months had passed since she went to the funeral plains, and he was already having trouble remembering what she looked like. He closed his hand around the locket and stood up.</p>
            <p>Monstruwacan Lanyard entered the meditation chamber. “It is time, my lord,” he said.</p>
            <p>The Master-designate nodded. It was only a short walk to the Kernel, which was housed inside a featureless, white-painted cube located at the exact centre of the pyramid.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>He sat cross-legged on a granite plinth. The walls of the spherical room were made from six-foot thick black glass and were, so far as he could see, featureless. He had read detailed accounts of the room’s manufacture in the Vault of Ages. Written from the perspective of the Guilds involved, they were mostly heroic tales of success against the impossible odds thrown up by physics, mathematics, and chemistry. The Guild of Glassmen were especially unstinting in singing their own praises. He conceded that they had a point; the glass sphere was a masterpiece of fabrication. Although he knew, more or less, where the door had been, he could see no sign of its circular outline. It was as if it had been created to allow his entry, and ceased to exist when its job was done.</p>
            <p>The room was lit by a soft, shadowless light that fell almost unnoticed from the walls. The annals of the Glassmen claimed that an intense, burning light had been focussed on the sphere for a hundred years. The glass had swallowed every scintilla and, so convoluted and cunning was its microscopic structure, it would take many tens of millions of years before the last of the imprisoned light had seeped through.</p>
            <p>With heart pounding, he closed his eyes and opened his mind.</p>
            <p>He was breath and animal electricity, sinew and blood, mind and soul, a self-ordered maelstrom working in miraculous sympathy. But it was not enough. Though strong in both the Night Hearing and the Master-Word, he needed the Kernel’s help for the task ahead. Its glass walls hid cunning designs; buried inside it lay the last great work of the Electromechanics Guild. Cautiously, he let his mind brush against the invisible filigree of superconducting wires and neural nets hidden in the glass. It was like touching a cloud of razor blades that coruscated with lightning.</p>
            <p>Consciously, he stilled his self-awareness and joined with the machine. His perception expanded, searching for the Master-Word, that undeniable measure of all true humans. The Gallowglass and the Moramor were standing shoulder to shoulder outside the Kernel. Their purity of heart was unquestioned and evoked a thrilling race memory of the forefathers and foremothers. Lanyard and the other Monstruwacans also shone with the Master-Word, but to a lesser degree than the Lords of the Prefecture.</p>
            <p>How ironic, he thought, that the Prefects, so strong in the essence of humanity, would not pass their seed to subsequent generations. Yet it had always been so — the Prefect’s oath setting them apart and above the petty concerns of the world.</p>
            <p>His mind went back to the ancient labours of his people. For five hundred years, the builders laboured on the mighty metal pyramid and the delvings beneath. A hundred thousand men stood shoulder to shoulder, and repelled the beasts of the Night. Four times that many, men and women both, quarried stone and ore, smelted metal and forged girders, dug deep and secret tunnels, or wrested life from the frozen black soil. Generations lived and died as the second greatest structure in human history rose to defy the endless night. When their task was done, the surviving three hundred thousand souls stood in massed ranks around the pyramid, raised a defiant song, then retreated into their final home.</p>
            <p>The bubble of his search expanded, rushing past the few pinpricks of humanity in the rest of the metal pyramid, out into the dark night, and downwards to the hidden homes of man. He brushed against hundreds, then thousands of people. The Master-Word lit them, to varying degrees; but it burned brightly in few. Consciously, he slowed the onward rush his awareness, the better to rejoice in their anthem, thin though it was. It was a thousand warm homecomings - laughing children, buttered toast, soft embraces - infinitely more than anything built of metal or stone, it was home.</p>
            <p>He left comfort behind and voyaged into the dark.</p>
            <p>At first there was nothing, then Night fell across his mind. It was worse than the literal cold and dark outside the Redoubt. It negated hope, and screamed with accusations. The cries of condemned children came to him.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p><i>For pity’s sake, how could you do this to us?</i></p>
            <p>Because it is necessary for the survival of the human race.</p>
            <p><i>Murderer!</i></p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Leaving the ghosts behind, his spirit swept onwards, across the ruined valley floor. There were no human songs here, just the acid pinpricks of the beasts of the Night. They were alien, and easily dismissed. In the silence his search ascended to a new plane. He found what he was looking for.</p>
            <p>The Master-Word of Great Redoubt was distant, but strong:</p>
            <p><em>Where are you, our lost brothers and sisters?</em></p>
            <p>The lament of the five hundred million humans in the Great Redoubt flew across unknown, uncountable leagues, and strengthened his will. He knew it was Fool’s Gold, but he took what strength he could, then closed his heart to the great longing. Soon other voices began to nibble at the edges of his consciousness. He resisted for a short while, then opened himself to their angry chatter. It was like being drenched in foul-smelling icy water.</p>
            <p><em>You know who we are.</em></p>
            <p>Yes, you are the descendants of the walker tribes. Your ancestors strode beside the moving cities for aeons then, at the time of your greatest peril; we abandoned you to the night.</p>
            <p><em>The shame! The shame!</em></p>
            <p>You are not what I seek. We parted countless aeons past; so long ago that the disgrace of our betrayal is almost forgotten.</p>
            <p><em>Not by us! Never by us!</em></p>
            <p>Nor by me. The shame is eternal. Ultimately we must pay. But now you will let me pass.</p>
            <p><em>Go then . . . for now. The reckoning will wait.</em></p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>With an air of crushing disappointment, they subsided from his mind. He was astonished and mortified at their numbers and the vigour of their aberrant chorus, and their passing left a void like a ragged wound.</p>
            <p>In his mind, his body took a step on the valley floor. He felt the broken stones underfoot, and the icy wind in his face. The sky was grey-black and featureless, like some giant hand had clapped a cap over the world. He knew that image was uncomfortably close to the truth. In the rarely visited western quadrant of the Vault of Ages there was a single column dedicated to the lost science of astronomy. Examining it was one secret tests faced by every Master-designate. The ancient knowledge was always perilous, but the astronomy column had mired more would-be Masters than the rest of the Vault’s blandishments put together. Exotic worlds and living suns — millions of them — vibrant in the universe’s staggering immensity. Worst of all were poignant tales of Earth’s own moon, silver and beautiful, a friend when the sun hid.</p>
            <p>Until it was destroyed in a desperate attempt to keep the worst that the universe had to offer at bay.</p>
            <p>The records were unflinchingly detailed about the consequences of that rash act, almost as if the chroniclers had an urgent need to ensure that history did not repeat itself. He could not imagine any circumstances that would allow mankind the opportunity. If the fabled other planets had ever existed, they were lost forever now. When the moon exploded, debris had quickly spread into an implacable barrier around the Earth. Worse still, the massive gravitational shifts had slowly, but inexorably begun to de-spin the Earth.</p>
            <p>Hunching his shoulders against the cold, the Master followed the path of his mind’s eye. The going was hard. His imaginary hands and knees were lacerated in regular falls, and his back ached like he was carrying a great burden. The way took him by treacherous paths into dark valleys filled with things that chittered; he scrambled up razor-like desiccated rills, and along wind-swept spurs. Only from the highest peaks could he see his destination, but he could always sense it.</p>
            <p>He strode towards the blue glow in the West that marked the Shine.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>After a thirty-hour labour, Bergthora was so tired she couldn’t even hold her baby. The pain and effort, and several doses of poppy juice, had left her exhausted. The midwife held up the squalling red-faced boy while her husband dabbed her forehead with a cloth. The child looks so angry, she thought as she fell into a long, troubled sleep.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>At the last moment the Master Monstruwacan hesitated. The spirits of the Night crowded close.</p>
            <p><em>We will snare your soul as it takes wing. We will rend it to shreds and gobble it up.</em></p>
            <p>He ignored their spiteful taunts. They were dangerous to be sure, but they were small things, with petty hatreds. Mankind had defied their gibbering bile for millions of years.</p>
            <p>A perfect image of his wife formed in his mind’s eye. Beautiful and dying, holding their newborn baby in her arms, vowing that their souls would meet again.</p>
            <p>He knew who had put it there. He pushed the memory away, and stepped into The Shine.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Hugh the Jackotrade Master opened his toolbox and began to slowly pick out the tools of his trade. A couple of Engineers were watching him from outside the turbine housing. He could hear them muttering, but he wasn’t about to rush on their behalf. He had spent the last half an hour fending off questions from increasingly high-ranking Engineers. In the end he had to chase them away but a couple had remained to spy on him. He shuffled around behind the turbine housing, hoping they would leave him alone.</p>
            <p>The turbine had been cantilevered away from the Earth Current ring, but he could still feel its low vibration through the shining steel casing. It was rumoured that some Engineers slept under the ring, the better to sense its moods. It was undeniable that they had a close bond with their machines, so close that they were usually able to catch the subtle bite of corrosion long before it could cause serious damage. He needed to look closely before he could see the little pits mottling the shining blades. Although the damage was superficial, he was surprised at how extensive it was.</p>
            <p><em>No wonder they’re so irritable, you’d have expected them to catch this a lot earlier.</em></p>
            <p>He picked up a blue bottle half-filled with a viscous fluid and held it up to the light. A column of Jackotrades unwound from the main mass, and started to crawl sluggishly up the glass towards the light. Tut-tutting at their lethargy, he put the bottle down and picked up a rubber squeeze bulb. He sprayed the nutrient cocktail onto the turbine blade, taking care to lay trails between each little cluster of corrosion. Then he picked up the blue bottle, uncorked it and poured its contents onto the blade. In an instant, the Jackotrades spread along the nutrient trails, blind instinct leading the little machines to the places where their repair skills were needed.</p>
            <p>Hugh sat down and dug a mushroom and bilberry pasty and a bottle of watered-down wine out of his toolbox. He would wait an hour, before using the come-to-home tinctures. He fervently hoped that the Engineers would leave him in peace until then. But he doubted it.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The Earth was gone. He stood alone on an endless blue plain. The Fixed Giants sat at the corners of an enormous pentacle with him at its centre. Their shapes embodied an idea of perfection crafted aeons before the sun died — pyramid, cube, octagon, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. He had no conception of their size, only that the dim glimpses seen by the naked eye were a fraction of their true magnitude. Their vastness extended beyond mundane dimensions. At first he thought they were featureless but as he looked again, he realised that each was built from elements of the others — cubes inside pyramids inside octahedra - endlessly concatenated — winding back to find their origin had moved - had never really existed - a perpetual dance marrying energy and form. His consciousness expanded, letting him glimpse the true nature of the Fixed Giants.</p>
            <p>They had existed since the universe cracked open, and they expected to survive its entropic death agonies. He couldn’t comprehend how that was possible, and was terrified, so they anchored him to his own scrap of consciousness.</p>
            <p>It was a small kindness.</p>
            <p>He looked at the square and found himself staring back from the octahedron. His viewpoint encompassed the universe. Everything was in motion: stars, galaxies, living things, atoms, fractions of atoms, always searching for a new equilibrium then darting on, never satisfied.</p>
            <p>They took him back to the beginning.</p>
            <p>The universe exploded to life, birthing quick-burning, short-lived stars that destroyed themselves in fiery conflagrations, spreading their essence across the galaxy. He rode a burning wind pregnant with newly created heavy elements. They were inconceivably rare, but they tugged at each other and slowly, over vast gulfs of time, accumulated. Near the young stars, thousands of metal-rich protoplanets jostled for elbowroom. Collisions were frequent, and violent. Soon the deceptive peace of the solar system’s babyhood was banished as billion-year long bloodbath of planetary formation and destruction began.</p>
            <p>Further out, the giant planets were accumulating mass in a more sedate fashion — a hydrogen atom here, a water molecule there - they had time on their side. Aloof from the fiery maelstrom, their evolution was less hurried, but perhaps more sure-footed.</p>
            <p>His guides hurried him along.</p>
            <p>“Let me see.”</p>
            <p>They ignored him.</p>
            <p>Three billion years before his life began, he stood on the shore of a foul-smelling sea; the air was thick with volcanic dust and sheet lightning cracked perpetually across a rain-lashed sky. In the seething, sulphurous water simple molecules jockeyed for position, driven by the blind laws of chemical equilibrium and electrostatics. For aeons the random forces of nature threw up countless variations. A tiny fraction gained prominence for an instant then fell back into the seething equilibrium. Eventually, a molecule containing a five-ringed sugar, a phosphate group, and nitrogen-containing base bumped into a similar structure. The chain grew, and miraculous things began to happen. The new molecules of RNA shepherded amino acids together, weaving them into protective membranes. Soon, simple catalysts emerged. A mere half billion years later the first simple cells appeared, and a cosmic eye blink later humans cracked rocks together to make fire, and dreamed of the stars.</p>
            <p>The dream quickly died. Twenty million years of stagnation followed.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Monstruwacan Lanyard walked around the Kernel, his hands clasped behind his back and his head bowed. A gaggle of Monstruwacans burst into the room. Lanyard noticed the subtle hand signals flicking between the Moramor and the three Prefects guarding the Kernel.</p>
            <p>“How long has he been in there?” Monstruwacan Cambyses asked.</p>
            <p>“Three days and four hours and sixteen minutes,” Lanyard replied.</p>
            <p>“This is a day past the normal time. How do we know he’s alive in there?”</p>
            <p>Lanyard shrugged. “The annals suggest that the Kernel will open automatically in the event of the death of the designate.”</p>
            <p>“Naturally, the annals can always be believed,“ Cambyses sneered. ”Curse this waiting, I’ve half a mind to go in there and drag him out.”</p>
            <p>“That would be inadvisable, my lord,” a new voice said.</p>
            <p>“Ah, Lord Gallowglass,” Lanyard said, with a small smile at the back of the rapidly departing Cambyses. “Welcome back. I fear your wait is far from over.”</p>
            <p>“It will be over when it is over, my lord.”</p>
            <p>“Your stoicism does you credit. Some of my fellow Monstruwacans are getting impatient. That is understandable. The Master-designate is somewhat of an unknown quantity. He has only been a member of our order for twenty-four years — hardly enough time to get to know him.”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure you — and your fellows — have complete confidence in your candidate, my lord. Otherwise why would you have elected him to the highest office?”</p>
            <p>“Your are correct, Lord Gallowglass,” Lanyard said smoothly.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>He blinked — and found himself at the centre of the Circuit of Assessment. However, there were subtle differences. The walls and floors were still dead white, and soft white lights hung from the domed alabaster ceiling. But there was no sign of the circle of testing stations, with their banks of white dials with flickering white needles. The talc-faced Testors in their white smocks were also absent. He felt a slight pang of relief at that: even thirty-three years on, he still had the occasional bad dream about his Day of Assessment, and the Testors were always prominent in them.</p>
            <p>“Why have you brought me to this place?” he asked.</p>
            <p><em>What is the nature of the human soul?</em></p>
            <p>He laughed. “You would catechise me on the nature of existence? I feel inadequate to the task.”</p>
            <p><em>What is the nature of the human soul?</em></p>
            <p>“Very well. The soul is immortal and emanates from a single universal principle to which it is destined to return at the end of life.”</p>
            <p><em>Always?</em></p>
            <p>“There is a tradition that some soul-pairs are bound by love and will return to inhabit new bodies until, after aeons, the lovers unite.”</p>
            <p><em>Did you share such a love with your wife?</em></p>
            <p>He hesitated a long time before answering. “No. Our love was true, but it was for a single lifetime.”</p>
            <p><em>Is this humility?</em></p>
            <p>“Do not be absurd. Why have you created this place?”</p>
            <p>A dislocation passed through him, and he was standing in the Vault of Ages. Four black pillars, their crowns lost in the gloom high above, surrounded him. Black writing, in a thousand ancient and forgotten languages, flowed over their ebony surfaces.</p>
            <p><em>You know this place.</em></p>
            <p>“The four pillars of Heresy. Examining them is the sixty-second trial of a Master-designate. A dull exercise, perhaps that is why you have added these florid touches?”</p>
            <p><em>Tell us about your heresies.</em></p>
            <p>He pointed to the pillars in turn. “Primus: man is a fallen spirit who has forgotten his own divinity. Secundus: on death the soul may pass into the bodies of animals, even plants. Tertius: Transmigrations of the soul are tiny incidents in the great drama of world annihilations and restorations that occur over enormous periods of time. Quartus: the restoration of humanity depends both on human ethics and the performance of meritorious acts by an avatar of godhead.”</p>
            <p>On an impulse, he leaned forward and touched Secundus. For a moment the writing flowed over his hand, then the pillar’s dark animation died, and was replaced by pictograms and studded metal rings.</p>
            <p>“Why the mummery? Is this test just a show with mirrors and smoke? If this is the great secret that you hold in your cold hearts, them I have to —”</p>
            <p><em>Why did you touch Secundus?</em></p>
            <p>Before he could answer another dislocation swept him away. He was standing outside the Lesser Redoubt. The Great Door hung from its hinges and the pyramid was dark and silent. The hundred foot thick iron walls were gnawed through by red-brown corrosion.</p>
            <p>Another dislocation. He was standing on the ruined land at the base of Redoubt Hill — and his people were fighting for their lives. With suddenly preternatural vision, he saw every detail of their ordeal. The Prefects had formed a running phalanx, their Diskoi ladling out generous helpings of death to the beasts of the Night. But their valour wasn’t enough. His people’s path was strewn with the bodies of the fallen, and hideous things were gleefully picking them over. He glanced to the West where the blue glow from the Shine washed over high, unscalable cliffs. When he looked back, the Prefects had been broken. Hairy beast men shrieked with joy as they fell upon the humans.</p>
            <p>Unable to watch any more, he hid his face. The earth under him was slick and chilly, and buzzed incessantly. A thin, icy wind carried the dying screams to him. Shamed by his cowardly refusal to witness the end of his people, he steeled himself and looked up. The battle was over. The Earth was stained by a five-mile long trail of blood. Oddly, the beasts of the Night were running away from the carnage. Sick to his heart, he realised that he could sense their feelings — they were terrified.</p>
            <p>He examined the knot of pain eating at his heart. What he felt wasn’t the Master-Word. It was something else.</p>
            <p>“Secundus?”</p>
            <p>There was no reply but his words took wings like an Exhalation and filled the Night Land.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Among the ruin of his people, someone had survived. His vision blurred, and was reduced to peering myopically at the figure walking serenely through the ranks of monsters. He couldn’t even tell whether it was a man or a woman. Whoever it was, he or she had an air of connection to everything in the world. He had been terrified by his own glimpse into the hearts of the inhuman hordes, but this person was possessed of another order of consciousness entirely.</p>
            <p>“Who is this?”</p>
            <p><em>A human born within the last year — and a hope for the future of the world.</em></p>
            <p>“A child of the Lesser Redoubt? What do you mean the hope of the world?”</p>
            <p><em>The child represents a novel — and surprising — iteration of humanity, and is the final chance for your species to fulfil its potential.</em></p>
            <p>“We have managed for twenty million years, we survived the stilling of Earth’s rotation, the fall of Night, and the death of the Sun—”</p>
            <p><em>Irrelevant — your greatest achievement has been millions of years of stagnation — and your days are numbered. Your pitiful metal tent is failing. Even the Great Redoubt is doomed. Their decline is slower, but no less certain. Humanity has nearly run its course and the universe will hardly notice its passing.</em></p>
            <p>“What can one child do?”</p>
            <p><em>The child is not alone. Another has come into this world — you know where.</em></p>
            <p>“The Great Redoubt. They outnumber us ten-thousand-fold.”</p>
            <p><em>Numbers are irrelevant. Chance is everything. If this special child survives to maturity, and if it meets its soul mate, their genes will cascade down future generations. Humanity will have a small chance to regain its lost vigour. One day your species might even realise its true place in the cosmos and, eventually gain the strength to reach out into the wider universe.</em></p>
            <p>Laughter rose in Master-designate’s breast. He folded his arms over his chest. “Well, what you ask of me is a simple matter. All I have to do is find this child — one among hundreds — ensure it grows up; then deliver it to the Great Redoubt, which has been lost to us for eight million years. Even if I knew where it was, there is the small matter of the countless leagues of the Night Land, with its untold horrors to —”</p>
            <p><em>We will ensure the child’s safety.</em></p>
            <p>“You need this child as much as humanity does.”</p>
            <p><em>You are placing interpretations on reality based on your limited knowledge of the universe. The concept of need is redundant in our terms. Will you pay the price to save the child?</em></p>
            <p>“What is the price?”</p>
            <p><em>You must destroy the Lesser Redoubt and cast your people into the Night Land. The hammer and anvil of Darkness will decide who is worthy.</em></p>
            <p>“Impossible. How can you expect me to commit such a crime?”</p>
            <p><em>Signs will be made evident to you. The price must be paid.</em></p>
            <p>The Master-designate sneered. “That is not good enough — I cannot be expected to make guesses —”</p>
            <p><em>What single achievement would you want to stand as your monument?</em></p>
            <p>The answer was so obvious that he spent several moments trying to find hidden meanings in their words. In the end he decided that the question must be without guile, or if there were any, it was behind his comprehension.</p>
            <p>“If I survive this test, I will seek what every Master Monstruwacan during the last eight million years has sought — the building of a working Master-Word machine.”</p>
            <p><em>Why?</em></p>
            <p>“So we can regain contact with the hundreds of millions of humans in the Great Redoubt, so we can unite humanity and, ultimately, cast you and your kin from this planet.”</p>
            <p><em>A paltry ambition.</em></p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>He stood on the frozen broken plain. The frigid wind scoured his face with sharp blue snowflakes that stuck to his skin and refused to melt, sucking the heat from him. The Fixed Giants looked on, impassive as mountains.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?” he shouted.</p>
            <p>There was no reply.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The Master Monstruwacan climbed out of the Kernel and looked straight through the waiting Prefects. They saluted, but he did not notice. Nor did he notice the ranks of kneeling Monstruwacans. A man carrying a ruby-coloured robe approached him. He said something, but his words were unintelligible. It was as if an insect had learned to speak. He laughed at the idea of the man rubbing his legs together, frantically producing staccato stridulations. The man draped the robe across the new Master’s shoulder and pushed his face close. There was something familiar about his eyes and the look of concern on his face.</p>
            <p>“Lanyard?” the Master said, his comprehension returning, along with crushing disappointment. He was one of the insects.</p>
            <p>“Yes, my lord. You are alive, we were sick with worry.”</p>
            <p>“I was only in there a few minutes.”</p>
            <p>“My lord, you were gone of the best part of a week.”</p>
            <p>The Master pushed Lanyard gently aside. Distantly he realised that his body was a mass of aches and pains, and he was desperately in need of sleep.</p>
            <p>“I must take my rest now, Master Lanyard. When I rise I wish to speak to the Gallowglass.”</p>
            <p>“And the Monstruwacan Council, my lord?”</p>
            <p>“Maybe later. The Gallowglass first.”</p>
            <p>As he limped out of the room, escorted by a pair of Prefects, the new Lord of the Redoubt left behind the frenzied whispers of his fellow Monstruwacans.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The Guild of Ancestors was one of the smallest and least prestigious of the Lesser Redoubt’s two hundred and six Guilds and Orders. It had three dozen active members, and several of them were over a hundred years old. The air in their tiny Guild House was thick with dust and the savoury tang of varnish and glue. The Master Monstruwacan and the Gallowglass had to stoop to avoid banging their heads on the low wood-beamed ceilings.</p>
            <p>“Who is in charge here?” the Master asked.</p>
            <p>A glance propagated down the ragged line of Guildmen in front of the Master, before settling on a bald man who took a reluctant step forward, gulped silently a couple of times, then puffed his chest out.</p>
            <p>“I am Hobnil, Master of the esteemed Guild of Ancestors.”</p>
            <p>The Master bowed slightly, setting off a wave of bowing and scraping by the Guildmen. One of them surreptitiously handed Hobnil the sacred Almanac of their calling. He held it close to his chest like a shield.</p>
            <p>“Thank you, gentlemen. I would ask you too leave now. I will to speak with Master Hobnil in private,” the Master said.</p>
            <p>The Guildmen reluctantly shuffled out of the room, with many a backward glance. Individually, they were weak in the Master-Word, but collectively the Master could hear their unspoken annoyance. Beside him the Gallowglass was bristling with suspicion.</p>
            <p>“Ahem, Master?” Hobnil said, nervously.</p>
            <p>“I have a job for your Guild,” the Master said. “It will suit your unique talents —”</p>
            <p>“We are eager to serve, my lord!” Hobnil said, a little too quickly.</p>
            <p>“This thing must be done in secret, and no word of it must pass beyond the confines of your Guild House.”</p>
            <p>Hobnil’s face fell. “Yes, Master, I suppose we can do that — I mean — whatever you say, my lord.”</p>
            <p>“Good. The Gallowglass will advise you on security measures.”</p>
            <p>Hobnil visibly blanched at this idea, and there was a clatter from behind the one of the room’s closed doors.</p>
            <p>“It seems that there is much for the Gallowglass to do,” the Master said. Hobnil nodded his head dumbly. “You keep records of all children born in the Redoubt —”</p>
            <p>It was not a question, but that did not stop Hobnil answering. “Yes, my lord. Births, deaths, marriages, Guildings —” He saw the look on the Master’s face and stopped talking.</p>
            <p>“I want you to keep watch on all of the children born between one year ago and one year from today. I want a report on each child every six months. I want to know about their growth, their accomplishments, their friendships, their beliefs, their performance in the Circuit of Assessment — anything that speaks of their future lives.”</p>
            <p>“But, my lord, we are not equipped to gather such information, my Guild’s high reputation is based on the storage of genealogical knowledge, we are ill-equipped to act as, well —”</p>
            <p>“Spies? You are correct, that is why I have today promulgated a decree granting you the extra funds needed to expand the size of your Guild six-fold.”</p>
            <p>Hobnil beamed at the news. “My lord!”</p>
            <p>“Of course, such an increase in status will not pass unnoticed, and will certainly lead to petty jealousies among some other Guilds. To avoid too much scrutiny of your secret work, the decree also requires you to apprentice girls. That innovation should be enough to deflect attention away from matters I want hidden.”</p>
            <p>Hobnil tilted his head to one side, then to the other, as if he was trying to hear a faint, distant noise.</p>
            <p>“I am sorry, my lord,” he said eventually. “I must have misheard — girls?”</p>
            <p>“Your hearing is adequate, Master Hobnil. Most Guilds will eventually be expected to recruit female apprentices, but yours has the honour of being the first. The interest that this innovation causes should be enough of a smokescreen. In any case, the task will require women; there are many situations where a man would stand out like a sore thumb. The care of young children for example.”</p>
            <p>Master Hobnil nodded, his eyes focussing on mid-air.</p>
            <p>“Good, now I will leave you in the capable hands of the Gallowglass,” the Master said. “You should know that his Prefects have already taken up defensive stations around your Guild. This heightened security will help in the changes that are needed.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, my lord.” Hobnil said gloomily. “One more thing: you say you are interested in all of the children born during these years — I assume the edict does not include your own daughter, sweet little Naani?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, it does. All of the children — no exceptions.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Things were moving on the plain below the Redoubt. Summoned by bells, a dozen pairs of Prefects stood shoulder-to-shoulder, ready to repel any attackers. The Moramor watched wheeled things rolling towards the foot of Redoubt Hill, and the legions of beasts following in their wake. Grimly, he ordered reinforcements.</p>
            <p>It was an hour before an attacker reached the apex of the pyramid. The Moramor despatched the creature with a coruscating slash of his Diskos. Battle was joined. A week passed before the creatures of the Night ended their assault.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The Gallowglass stood to attention just inside the doorway. From there he had a good view of the Master Monstruwacan’s Audience Chamber. It was an unusual room, even for the Lesser Redoubt. Decagonal in shape, its vaults dwarfed the people clustered on its floor and walls. On the two sloping walls adjacent to the door ten pairs of Prefects stood to attention. The four walls behind the Master’s dais belonged to the Monstruwacan Council. The benches were full today, with most of the two hundred and twenty-six council members present. Many of them were lolling back in their seats however, and it seemed that a few were actually asleep. Of the many innovations introduced by the young Lord of the Redoubt, Petitions Day was among the least popular.</p>
            <p>Though not the most hated, the Gallowglass thought, the Master’s five-year-old decree requiring the acceptance of girls as apprentices, was still deeply resented by many. In his heart, the Gallowglass sympathised with the stick-in-the-muds who were holding out. Though women would never be introduced to the ranks of the Prefecture, the idea was deeply unsettling. He knew his duty, however, and had been quite ruthless in stamping out the few signs of outright resistance to the reforms.</p>
            <p>The all-male Monstruwacans shifted uneasily in their seats (another unpopular innovation had decreed the removal of cushions), and glared balefully at the petitioners. The Gallowglass, who was naturally strong in the Night Hearing, suspected that their collective bile might be curdling milk all over the Redoubt.</p>
            <p>The Master’s Clerk stepped forward and handed an Hour-Slip to his Lord.</p>
            <p>"This petition is highly unusual," the Master Monstruwacan said after a brief glance at the slip. "I am surprised that that they managed to pursue it as far as my office."</p>
            <p>The Clerk kept a blank expression on his face, but, when his lord's attention turned away from him, he shuffled a step away from the steel dais. Silence fell in the chamber as the Master silently read the petition.</p>
            <p>The Lord of the Lesser Redoubt put the slip down on his lap and stared at the ragged bunch of postulants. Most of the half dozen men and women suddenly found something fascinating about their own feet. All except one, a woman with curled red hair. She kept her head high, and looked around the room with the air of someone who was determined to take in its splendours, whatever the cost. The Gallowglass wondered whether she appreciated the danger her impudence placed her in. For sure, many council members would have ordered her cut down already. He reflected that she probably had quite an attractive face, but her features were buried under a checkerboard of roughly applied, brightly-coloured face paints, making it impossible to guess her age. Her dress was clean, but ragged and festooned with bright coloured ribbons.</p>
            <p>He was surprised that the Master had allowed the petition to get this far, but perhaps less surprised than anyone else in the room. Just two weeks ago, he had stood beside the man outside the Circuit of Assessment, while the child Naani was tested. The Master’s mental sigh of relief when the girl was found to be a true human was full of love and fear.</p>
            <p>The Gallowglass looked at the woman: he knew her sort. In the records of the Prefecture there were histories reaching beyond the age of the Road Builders, to the shadowy origins of Mankind. The oldest texts were written in languages too antique to comprehend, but there were translations of translations of translations that recorded remarkably consistent ancient heresies. The cults described all had certain beliefs in common: a charismatic, conveniently absent leader who would come back one day to lead his followers to some ill-definite promised land, or who would rescue them from whatever evil was currently stalking them. Of course, you had to be a special person to benefit — someone whom the god especially loved, usually because he had been propitiated with payers and other offerings. The rest of humanity would be left to the tender mercies of the beasts.</p>
            <p>He could put a name to this cult’s special little god — Harlequin — the enigmatic, mischievous will-o-the-wisp who had reached the apogee of his popularity three million years ago, before being wiped out in a bloody pogrom by one of his predecessors. He made a mental note to have the Moramor investigate the extent of the cult's influence. Most likely the handful of fanatics standing in front of him comprised the entire gang, but it was best to be sure.</p>
            <p>The Master seemed about to dismiss the petitioners when the woman stepped closer. Astonishment rippled around the room and several council members shouted out. She stopped, her right foot almost touching the broad gold band that surrounded the dais. On it were inscribed the names of the thirty-seven thousand six hundred and fifteen Master Monstruwacans who had ruled in the eight million years since the Lesser Redoubt was raised.</p>
            <p>The Master Monstruwacan help his hand up to stop her taking the fatal step, "Child, your persistence does you credit. I will judge your petition."</p>
            <p>The woman fell to her knees. "Noble Lord," she said, "we humbly beg you to consider our proposal—"</p>
            <p>A tall, white-haired Monstruwacan rose to his feet waving his fossilised wax staff of office.</p>
            <p>"Enough of this! My Lord, why waste time on these low rascals? Be rid of them and let us consider more pressing matters."</p>
            <p>"Master Beekeeper," the Master Monstruwacan said in an icy voice, "you have another appointment perhaps?"</p>
            <p>"My Lord, of course not."</p>
            <p>"Then sit down, this will not take up much more of your precious time."</p>
            <p>The Bee Master sat down, hiding his anger by burying his face in a little flowering lithops he carried in a tapered terracotta pot that hung from a chain around his neck. The Gallowglass wondered exactly what ill odour his nosegay guarded him against.</p>
            <p>The Master nodded to the woman. “Please continue,” he said.</p>
            <p>"I speak on behalf of the doomed children, My Lord. Though they are ab-human, they are still innocents," she said.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I have read your petition, child. What do you seek?" the Master said, shifting uncomfortably on his throne. It had been a long day. Unconsciously, he fingered the plain gold locket resting on his chest. "It is Law. On a child’s fifth birthday, it is taken to the Circuit of Assessment. If it is found to be ab-human, it must leave the Redoubt or accept mercy. Would you allow the creatures of the Night a foothold among us?"</p>
            <p>"No, My Lord. We do not question Law's necessity. But, we humbly beseech you to let us give them the boon of a little training in wilderness craft, and . . . the mercy of Harlequin's teachings."</p>
            <p>“That they will get pie in the sky when they die?”</p>
            <p>“That is an oversimplification,” the woman said. She had to raise her voice to be heard over the Council’s laughter.</p>
            <p>“Or will they have to wait for Judgement Day? That should be interesting, hearing your little God explain himself.” More laugher echoed around the chamber. The Master leaned forward. “He has twenty million years of mankind’s suffering to answer for,” he said.</p>
            <p>The woman lowered her head, and shook it almost imperceptibly. The Gallowglass looked at her carefully. There was something familiar about her but, when he tried a mental probe, it slid away from the surface turmoil of her thoughts.</p>
            <p>"You asked for them to be give wilderness training?” he said. “And where did you pick up such unusual skills? Surely you have not been outside the Redoubt? You know the punishments — especially for a woman."</p>
            <p>"Yes, My Lord, and no, My Lord it has been time out of mind since our people sallied into the great darkness outside, but we have honed our skills in the monstrous caverns of the Country of Husbandry, far beyond the populated parts of the Redoubt."</p>
            <p>"And what discoveries did you chance upon in the noisome dark?"</p>
            <p>The woman raised her head and looked straight at the Master Monstruwacan.</p>
            <p>"The Country of Husbandry is a place where men go as quietly as ghosts. The dreary souls, who come to take our dead on their last journey, are a tithe of the forgotten tribe who dwell there amid the silence. They have little ken of the rest of humanity, and less concern for our doings. Limitless, vast caverns are their domain and they guard their deepest places jealously—"</p>
            <p>"Why? What is down there?" he demanded.</p>
            <p>"I cannot say, My Lord. The followers of Harlequin only touch upon the fringes of the deep. We have no wish, or need to delve deeper. The places we know are harsh enough for the teaching of the skills. Harlequin teaches us that we should take only what suffices our needs, and give generously—"</p>
            <p>The Master's patience evaporated. "So, in truth, you know little about the deep places of our world."</p>
            <p>"No, Lord."</p>
            <p>"You are dismissed."</p>
            <p>"What about our petition?"</p>
            <p>"Do not anger me further," the Master said. “Gallowglass!”</p>
            <p>The Prefects sprang to life, spinning their Diskoi in furious salute as the Gallowglass marched forward. With a hand signal, he stilled his men’s electric fury and knelt before the Master.</p>
            <p>"How may I serve, My Lord?"</p>
            <p>"Rise, friend Gallowglass. I will have need of your council. First, please remove these people."</p>
            <p>The Gallowglass made another hand signal, and two of his men advanced on the petitioners. In a trice the petitioners were hustled out of the room. The Master leaned back and looked at the ceiling high above. The minutes ticked by while everyone else waited for him to speak.</p>
            <p>"Clerk," the Master said.</p>
            <p>"Yes, My Lord," the Clerk said as he stepped forward.</p>
            <p>“Stand there.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, My Lord.”</p>
            <p>"Gallowglass, I want you to investigate this cult," the Master said. He pointed at his Clerk. "This one is in league with them. Extract what you can from him. Then we will decide how to deal with that heretical rabble."</p>
            <p>White-faced, the Clerk fell to his knees. Two Prefects moved swiftly and grabbed him, twisting his arms behind his back. They pulled him to his feet and started to drag him out of the hall.</p>
            <p>"My Lord, I beg you," the Clerk shouted. "I care not what happens to me but, please, grant the petition."</p>
            <p>"Even now, when you are condemned, you seek this boon from me?" The Master said, astonished.</p>
            <p>"My life is as nothing, My Lord."</p>
            <p>"Oh, very well," the Master said eventually.</p>

            <p>Later in his private office, the Master Monstruwacan examined a diorama standing on an agate pedestal at the centre of the room. Inside a six-foot tall cylindrical diamond, Jackotrades had created an intricate representation of the Lesser Redoubt. Myriads of the tiny machines had carved subtle interference grooves and gratings that, when viewed from the correct angle, created the illusion of solid shapes and colours. At his eye-level, there was a miniature of the mile-high metal pyramid that was the only visible sign of the Redoubt. He looked closely, fancying that he could almost see tiny human figures at the apex. Under the pyramid, a long blue pipe fell ten miles into the Earth, and connected to a flat green disk, ten miles in diameter. This was where the bulk of the Redoubt’s population lived. It was where their fields, manufactories and homes lay. At the centre of the disk, a mottled green ball marked the Flying Wood, hanging over the Great Arbour. Blue tetrahedra signifying Guild Houses dotted the circumference, while a single red octahedron identified the Vault of Ages. Under the Arbour, a bright yellow band was cut into the native rock. This was Earth-Current generator — the source of all energy within the Redoubt.</p>
            <p>He walked around the diamond and his perspective changed. The model of the Redoubt was replaced by a series of smaller images: the Pyramid standing on Redoubt Hill, overlooking the black plains below; details of the Stress Master’s engines in the central shaft and beyond — none of them interested him. He changed his position again; this time finding images of the fringes of his domain — the Country of Husbandry — and the dubious lands beyond.</p>
            <p>As he examined these unknown regions an old quotation came to mind — here be dragons — and a tear trickled down his face.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Filangeri the Stress Master herded the passengers onto the granite disk. He wasn't in a good mood. Normally he would have left such a task to a minion, but an Hour-Slip signed in the Master Monstruwacan's own hand had demanded his participation.</p>
            <p>Transporting ab-human children to the fringes of the Country of Husbandry was tedious and distasteful to him. The boy appeared normal enough, except for his perpetual smile. The religious woman frowned as he instructed her in the proper protocols. The two Prefects escorting them simply ignored him.</p>
            <p>Filangeri prodded a flake of something blue that was resting on the burnished control panel. The woman's face and arms were covered in multi-coloured daubings, and he had no doubt where the guilt lay. Fastidiously, he moistened the end of a finger and picked up the flake. His passengers were looking strangely at him, probably wondering why he didn’t leave such a minor imperfection for the Jackotrades to clean up. He ignored their stares; he didn’t trust the little machines to do a thorough job.</p>
            <p>He instructed the passengers to grab firm hold of the handrail that sprouted from the centre of the disk. Typically, the Prefects declined, settling for grounding the butts of their weapons for balance.</p>
            <p>"Please hold on tight," Filangeri said. "The ride is long and can make some people a little nauseated. We will start now."</p>
            <p>He pushed a brass lever, and the granite cylinder they were standing on began to fall. At first the movement was slow but, once the embarkation room was clear, the pace picked up. The smooth walls of the pipe became blurred with speed as the platform plunged downwards. Filangeri fussed over his instruments — speed, vibration, air pressure, temperature, static electricity — all were within accepted limits. There was a chattering of hour printers as the cylinder flashed through a junction. Filangeri scanned the slips quickly. Everything seemed in order. Back at the central nexus, his minions seemed to be doing their jobs adequately.</p>
            <p>But he couldn't help but worry. The adjustment of forces needed to maintain the equilibrium between ascending cylinders with descending ones, and the balancing of hundreds of tonnes of moving rock and miles of stretching, articulating metal, was a subtle skill only understood by a master like himself.</p>
            <p>"How long?" The woman asked.</p>
            <p>"We will soon reach the first airlock," Filangeri said without turning.</p>
            <p>He tilted his head. There was a noise. It was nothing really, just an overtone in the pure note generated by the cylinder's fall. He tapped a dial, wondering if there was a problem with the vertebral reciprocating assembly.</p>
            <p>"Stop that at once," the woman said.</p>
            <p>Fuming, Filangeri spun round ready to replay her presumption with scalding invective. Then he saw what the real problem was. The boy had left the handrail and, quite incredibly, was standing at the edge of the disk poking a hand in the stream of air dashing through the finger-wide gap between the wall and cylinder. Filangeri was apoplectic.</p>
            <p>"Stop that at once, boy!" he stammered.</p>
            <p>The boy giggled. He knew no one would stop his little game until the ride was over.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The bodies were arranged in a neat row. Two Perfects and a corpulent man whose fine clothes had been ruined by the blood that had flowed from his cut throat. The bodies were several days old and the younger Prefect, although standing stiffly to attention, was visibly fighting the urge to gag. The Moramor made a mental note to arrange for suitable training to rid him of this foible.</p>
            <p>Small cloth dolls had been found resting beside each body. The Gallowglass twirled one of them in his fingers. They were colourful but crudely made from scraps and coarse thread.</p>
            <p>“The Harlequin sect?” the Prefect asked.</p>
            <p>“Start the hunt,” the Moramor said.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>The Gallowglass was uncomfortable. He was used to the sharp angles and smooth surfaces of the Prefecture. The Master Monstruwacan’s home had shaded alcoves and curtains. A bowl of peppermint comfits stood on a sandalwood table.</p>
            <p>Somehow, despite knowing that the Master had a child, he had not expected her presence to so influence his Lord’s home. Bowls of petits pois scented the air and a set of wooden alphabet tiles had spilled from a low table onto the floor. Their five-year old owner sat on her father’s lap, and was scowling.</p>
            <p>"It's not fair!" she said</p>
            <p>"No, it isn't my sweet," the Lord of the Lesser Redoubt said. "But I have business of state to deal with. Here's Tanna, go with her. It's getting late, I'll come by to tuck you in later."</p>
            <p>Naani stuck her bottom lip out. "Don't want to be tucked in."</p>
            <p>"Oh, now what a thing to say," the maid said, as she swept the child up in her arms. "Don't you worry, My Lord. This little one will be on her best behaviour when next you see her."</p>
            <p>"Don't chastise her too much; I did promise to play with her this evening."</p>
            <p>The maid curtsied, and herded Naani out of the library. She glanced at the Gallowglass as she left, then looked away quickly.</p>
            <p>“Gallowglass, please come in,” the Master said.</p>
            <p>He limped in and knelt on his right knee before his lord, placing his Diskos on the floor beside him. His armour was splattered with dirt and dry stains that might have been blood. There was tang of ozone in the air, a sure sign that he had been in battle, and his face was grim.</p>
            <p>"Is the rebellion dealt with?" the Master asked.</p>
            <p>"I would hardly call it a rebellion—"</p>
            <p>"I did not ask for your analysis of the political situation, Gallowglass. Have the heretics been put down?"</p>
            <p>The Gallowglass shifted his position and rested a hand on the floor for a moment before answering.</p>
            <p>"Yes, My Lord. Half of the sect members were taken alive, and are being put to the question as we speak."</p>
            <p>"How many in total?"</p>
            <p>"Seventy-six."</p>
            <p>"Seventy-six? So few, yet they had the confidence to resist your investigations and, when you hunted them down, stand and fight? You are slipping, my friend."</p>
            <p>The Gallowglass bowed his head. "I beg your forgiveness."</p>
            <p>"Did you find the ab-human boy or the woman?"</p>
            <p>"No, My Lord, nor any evidence of their accomplices. But for sure there must have been others, a small boy and a woman could not overcome two Prefects.”</p>
            <p>"Did you find any evidence to link the cult with the murders?"</p>
            <p>The Gallowglass held up a small rag doll. "This token of their sect was found with the bodies. It is more than enough to condemn them all."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I suppose it is," the Master said, imagining the fury of the Prefects when they discovered the killers of their comrades. Something in the Gallowglass' expression caught his eye.</p>
            <p>"There is something else?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, My Lord. Our investigations of the Stress-Masters Guild turned up an interesting Hour-Slip. It held an order for Filangeri to escort the ab-human boy to the lower chambers — seemingly it was signed by you — the sigils upon the slip are almost indistinguishable from the real ones."</p>
            <p>"That is impossible."</p>
            <p>“Apparently not,” the Gallowglass said dryly. “The Stress Masters deny that they have any record of the Hour-Slip passing through their hands. They offered to open their achieves to me, the better to prove their innocence. I declined. If they are capable of forging your sigils, hiding a paper trail would be of little difficulty.”</p>
            <p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
            <p>“I would like to kick the doors of the Stress-Masters' Guild in and tear the place apart until I found answers.” The Gallowglass paused for a moment, perhaps waiting for his Lord to speak, before continuing. “But that is impossible. The Guilds hold their secrets tight under ancient laws. We must seek other sources of information.”</p>
            <p>“You have my full confidence, Gallowglass,” the Master said, with a tone of dismissal in his voice.</p>
            <img class="lesser-separator" src="../media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
            <p>Bergthora watched as the Master ran his hand over the sandstone wall.</p>
            <p>“Is this room secure?” the Master asked.</p>
            <p>“The walls are lined with Jackotrade-filled capillaries, My Lord,” Bergthora said. “We are hidden from the mental sight of your fellow Monstruwacans. Are you afraid that they suspect something?”</p>
            <p>“Not really, they always suspect something, lack of trust it is in their nature. With the murders—”</p>
            <p>“Surely that is a matter for the Prefects? Aren’t they who we should worry about?”</p>
            <p>“I can deal with the Prefects. Their straightforwardness makes them easy to manipulate. I laid a false trail leading into the heart of the Stress-Masters' Guild.”</p>
            <p>“That’s clever.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you.”</p>
            <p>“I wasn’t being sarcastic, My Lord. The Prefects could beat their heads against that immovable object for weeks and still be no wiser. The capacity of your mind is not in doubt — after all that is why you are the youngest Master in recorded history.”</p>
            <p>“No it isn’t,” he said under his breath, his face turned away from the woman.</p>
            <p>“Did you say something?”</p>
            <p>“I do not know whether I did the right thing.”</p>
            <p>“In trusting me?”</p>
            <p>“In not having your son cast out of the Redoubt as Law demands. He failed the Circuit of Assessment, so I doubt he is worthy. In any case, there is a better than one in sixty chance that he is not the child I seek.”</p>
            <p>Bergthora noticed that he had not answered her question about trust. “That calculation has always been true. Yet you let him live. Your intentions were noble,” she said.</p>
            <p>“You do not know anything about my plans, and do not talk to me about good intentions — you are his mother.”</p>
            <p>“And you are complicit in the murder of two Prefects and a Stress-Master, not to mention a conspiracy to hide his survival, and you just ordered the deaths of over seventy members of my faith.”</p>
            <p>“You would blackmail me?”</p>
            <p>“Of course not, My Lord. I am forever in your debt. I merely point out that our paths are inextricably linked.”</p>
