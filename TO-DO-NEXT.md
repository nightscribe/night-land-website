    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater".

    - Changed my mind about the dimensions of Lightning, Black Lightning. It's back to separator size, but it has a frame.
    - Framed images are framed in $darker-red.

To Do:
    3-4 more image replacements for horizontal rules.
    Red lesser separator.
    Consider color shift for header and footer text.
    Clean up the mess of trial images in separators and illustrated-works.
