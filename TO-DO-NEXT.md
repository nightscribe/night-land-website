    Done:
        "Ex Machina" text ported. Page still needs work.
    To Do:    
        Brett Davidson's Night Wrights page needs linking after I make it.
        I haven't intended to finish any of the individual Night Wright pages yet, but the template for them is a bit muddled. The list styles are a mess. The longer it takes me to unmuddle it, the more pages I'll have to fix. I'll have to do a Night Wright page soon.
        Proofread "Ex Machina".
        "Ex Machina" is ~17,400 words and probably could use a table of contents on-page for the convenience of the reader. I made one. Only problem is, the HTML & CSS to assemble this with automatic numbering following the word 'Part ', since it has no chapter titles, are convoluted and absurd-looking. I'm not sure I should foist this off on my successor. At any rate it is currently functional but not yet pretty.
        Check links.
        Check other existing works (which right now are "Eater" and "Red Twilight") and make sure the title and author metadata make sense. Also the H1 and H2 headers. Add the illustrator metadata to those to stories and "Ex Machina."
        Consider hue changes in some Darkening headers, for more visual interest.
