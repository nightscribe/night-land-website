My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

I think the blockquote color is too dark.
