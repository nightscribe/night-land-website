    Just done:
    I decided to reorganize Night Wrights.
        1. The hour-slips more reasonably belongs in Night Musings. I moved the hour-slips subdirectory there. There are no Hour Slips yet.
        2. I moved the Night Wrights individual entries directly into night-wrights. There is now no need for a subdirectory.
        3. This means I broke a lot of links, in the night wrights template, in every individual night wright page, and in links to every individual night wright page that exists so far. I haven't fixed them yet.

    To Do Next:
        I fixed some links I broke. Find the other existing broken links to Night Wrights and fix them.
        Add the Hour Slips to the Night Musings subindex, which is not yet in any good order.

    What I was working on when I decided the above reorganization should happen:
        0-poetry-vignettes-template.html
        index-poetry-vignettes.html
        robertson--eater.html
        robertson--dream.html
        andy-robertson.html
        teoretisk.html
        
         Check links and descriptions on the Poetry and Vignettes template. Decide what to change the header illo to. Change the in-work example illo.        
        Format "Dream". It should likely have a spoiler warning. Link it to "Eater". Add Teoretisk's illustrations. Link to his Night Wright's profile, and Andy's.
        Write Teoretisk's Night Wright profile.
		Link "Eater" to "Dream."
        Link to "Dream" on Poetry and Vignettes subindex.
        Link to "Dream" and "Eater" on Andy Robertson's Night Wrights page.
