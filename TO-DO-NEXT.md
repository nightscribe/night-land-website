# Night Land Website

2025-11-20

The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So they also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

Can't link Night Wright artists gallery pages to their Night Wrights pages until I set up the gallery. Otherwise done so far: Andrea Bonazzi.

To Do Next:
    Got the ul.works-list no-bullet centering fixed by removing padding. Check other similar lists and see if they need the like.

    Maybe my Night Wright page. Or work on the Gallery.
