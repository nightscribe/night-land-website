    Just done:
    I decided to reorganize Night Wrights.
        1. The hour-slips more reasonably belongs in Night Musings. I moved the hour-slips subdirectory there. There are no Hour Slips yet.
        2. I moved the Night Wrights individual entries directly into night-wrights. There is now no need for a subdirectory.
        3. This means I broke a lot of links, in the Night Wrights template, in every individual night wright page, and in links to every individual Night Wright page that exists so far. I haven't fixed them yet.

    To Do Next:
        Every copyright section of existing pages is going to have broken links.
        Check all the other Night Wrights links on the pages that exist so far.

    What I was working on when I decided the above reorganization should happen:
        0-poetry-vignettes-template.html
        robertson--eater.html
        robertson--dream.html
        andy-robertson.html
        teoretisk.html
        
         Check links and descriptions on the Poetry and Vignettes template. Decide what to change the header illo to. Change the in-work example illo.        
        Format "Dream". It should likely have a spoiler warning. Link it to "Eater". Add Teoretisk's illustrations. Link to his Night Wright's profile, and Andy's.
        Write Teoretisk's Night Wright profile.
        Link to "Dream" and "Eater" on Andy Robertson's Night Wrights page.

        index-poetry-vignettes.html now has linked nav and copyright and links to "Dream." Also the Fabian green Redoubt as a header.
