# Night Land Website

2025-10-23

My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

I started making the Art Gallery index, replacing the logo and header images with Ray Leung's Night Land site intro. I rotated the page background image to make it match better with Mr. Leung's illo, but there's some visible discontinuity and I need to fix that.

Renamed the dark backgrounds to fabian--etc* because they turn out to be taken from a Fabian Watcher pic.
