# Night Land Website

2025-08-31

    Check "Dream" to see if any of the image links should be changed back to standard, since I'm now routinely using the red version of Tais Teng's header for the Darkening.

    I have begun "A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt", which at about 38,000 words is the longest single story on the site, aside from the coming _Anima._ In the Joomla version of the sight, I had to break it into 8 parts, because some of the author's sections were too long for a Joomla article. I restore it now to Nigel Atkinson's original 6 parts, on as many separate HTML pages, each of which will average about 6,000 words. Because that's pretty long, I am considering figuring out how to add sub-sections to the Table of Contents, for the convenience of the reader.

    To come: the next five story parts.
