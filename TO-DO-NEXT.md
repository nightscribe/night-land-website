# Night Land Website

My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

The header image and its caption look good. Next I need to lay out the rest of the page content.
