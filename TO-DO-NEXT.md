# Night Land Website

2026-2-5

Working on Chapter 2 of _The Night Land_ for the Last Redoubt section. The text and main illustrations are present. Check credits and links.

I now have a standard width of 98% for bordered images in last-redoubt.scss. This needs to be transferred to last-redoubt-red.scss and darkening.scss.

That'll be too wide for a few in-story illustrations, like the rune pic in "Eater". Give it an individual width.
