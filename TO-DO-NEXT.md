# Night Land Website

2025-07-09
Stylesheet reorganization:
    Each section of the site that has a different color scheme has its own main stylesheet. So far that's the Last Redoubt color scheme, and the Darkening color scheme.
    I now import SCSS reset, dimensions, fonts, and colors into the main stylesheets.
    
    To Do Next:
        0-stories-template-last-redoubt.html:
        robertson--eater.html:
            Fix what got broken when I used last-redoubt-index-page.scss to make the new main Last Redoubt sheet.
            Fix the placement and typography of the Tales of the Last Redoubt tag.
