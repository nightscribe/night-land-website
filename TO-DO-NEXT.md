    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". I have used Teoretisk's pics for the main illustrations. I've shifted the color of Tais Teng's plasma flame header and one of the existing separators I use in lieu of hr bars in the HTML. I'm still creating the separator graphics, and deciding which to use where.

    I'm making other fractals on the red-white-black theme of the text. Right now I have a fractal representing the black 'lightning tree' (it's a black Julia, sideways, against a crimson-to-black centered gradient, with fractal white lightning all around. It's presently installed at a separator size, but bordered, because the white lightning extends beyond the dimensions of a separator. However, I don't think this is the right treatment for it. It looks too neat, bordered; whereas Teoretisk's illustrations are jagged, stylized silhouettes. So I'm going to experiment with including the whole pic at illustration size, but instead of a border, I'll fade black to transparent at the edges so instead of lifting off the page like a discrete illustration, it still meshes with it like a separator.

    That is next.
