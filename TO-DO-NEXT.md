# Night Land Website

    Check "Dream" to see if any of the image links should be changed back to standard, since I'm now routinely using the red version of Tais Teng's header for the Darkening.

    I removed an extraneous bracket from multiple files.
    For the Last Redoubt CSS, I fixed the awkward bullet spacing in SCSS with ::marker, and fixed the .site-table-of-contents styling.

    To Fix: now the table of contents for individual works, like "Mouse", are aligned left. Make order out of such CSS and return it to centered.

    Then the changes have to be ported to stylesheets for Darkening and Last Redoubt Red.
