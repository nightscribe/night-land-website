# Night Land Website

2025-12-7

The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So these parts of _Salvage_ also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

Can't link Night Wright artists gallery pages to their Night Wrights pages until I set up the galleries. Otherwise done so far: Andrea Bonazzi.

I've put up Nigel Brown's "Catharsis" in Tales from the Last Redoubt.

To Do Next:
    Check breadcrumbs on existing Night Wright pages.
    Label Mary Chain/Maureen Shockey pics as shockey--* and check links to them.    
    Link Nigel Atkinson's and Tais Teng's pages back to "Red Giant's Race".
    I have permission from Ray Leung to use his image for the gallery header, so back to that version.
    I may want each artist's entry separate, not 3 in a row, for aesthetic reasons.
