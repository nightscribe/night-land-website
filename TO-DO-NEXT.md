I just made fixes to the tables of contents in the Last Redoubt story template, "Eater", "A Sequel to THE TIME MACHINE?", and the essay template. Also to the formatting for blockquotes in the Last Redoubt SCSS.
The fixes need to be copied to all parts of "Mouse"; "Red Twilight"; "Ex Machina"; "Across the Night Wall"; the poetry and vignettes template; and the darkening story template.
The blockquote formatting fix, and possibly some others, need to be copied from the Last Redoubt SCSS to Darkening and Last Redoubt Red.
