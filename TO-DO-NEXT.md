# Night Land Website

    Check "Dream" to see if any of the image links should be changed back to standard, since I'm now routinely using the red version of Tais Teng's header for the Darkening.

    I notice today that something has gone wacky with the menu bars. The vertical spacing between the borders and the text is too tall, in both current schemes. How did I achieve this? Anyway: fix it.

    To come: the next five story parts of "A Mouse in the Walls of the Lesser Redoubt".
