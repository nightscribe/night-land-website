# Night Land Website

2025-12-1

The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So these parts of _Salvage_ also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

Can't link Night Wright artists gallery pages to their Night Wrights pages until I set up the galleries. Otherwise done so far: Andrea Bonazzi.

I've moved over the MP3 sound files we were hosting at Andy's version of the site, and have renamed most of them for better identification. Most of the stuff Andy had in Night Songs was actually links to external hosting. Logically they would go in Links, but it may be more convenient to put them in the galleries anyway.

To Do Next:
    I have started the Night Galleries index page design. I also need template pages for the indivdual artists. Sound/Multimedia and visual static artists might not get the same template.
    I need to make a different separator, or separators, for the Night Gallery index because the existing large separator doesn't suit Leung's illo.
