# Night Land Website

    Done:
        "Ex Machina" text ported. Page still needs work.
    To Do:    
        Brett Davidson's Night Wrights page needs linking after I make it.
        I haven't intended to finish any of the individual Night Wright pages yet, but the template for them is a bit muddled. The list styles are a mess. The longer it takes me to unmuddle it, the more pages I'll have to fix. I'll have to do a Night Wright page soon.
        Check links.
        Check other existing works (which right now are "Eater" and "Red Twilight") and make sure the title and author metadata make sense. Also the H1 and H2 headers. Add the illustrator metadata to those to stories and "Ex Machina."
        Consider hue changes in some Darkening headers, for more visual interest.
