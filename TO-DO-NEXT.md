    "Dream" works and the directory is cleaned up.
    To Do:    
        Right now all the separators except for the red-shifted Tais Teng title image
        are in media/illustrated-works/robertson--dream/. I might use some
        of these separators in Darkening pieces. So maybe they should go into the general
        separators directory.

        Try replacing the Darkening header in "Red Twilight" with this red-shifted Tais Teng
        header and see how it looks.
