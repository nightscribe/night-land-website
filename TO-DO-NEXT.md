# Night Land Website

2026-1-25

The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So these parts of _Salvage_ also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

I added links from the Last Redoubt story index to stories and author pages so far extant. I set up "Imago" but have not transcribed yet. It's at least a two-parter. I created Don Webb's Night Wright page but I haven't added any content.

To Do Next:
    "Lute" needs an illo, links, and the footer set up.
    "An Exhalation of Butterflies" likewise.

    Check breadcrumbs on existing Night Wright pages.
   
    Link Nigel Atkinson's and Tais Teng's pages back to "Red Giant's Race".
    I have permission from Ray Leung to use his image for the gallery header, so back to that version.
    I may want each artist's entry separate, not 3 in a row, for aesthetic reasons.
