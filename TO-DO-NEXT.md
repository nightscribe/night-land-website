    Check "Dream" to see if any of the image links should be changed back to standard, since I'm now routinely using the red version of Tais Teng's header for the Darkening.

    'table of contents' has turned out to be confusingly ambiguous. There are index pages, and there are tables of contents on the pages of individual long works. HTML and CSS must be disentangled in every existing work, template, and stylesheet.

    Check the intro section articles. In-page bookmarks should have a different header illo, for variety.
