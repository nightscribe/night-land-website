    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". I rerendered the Lightning Black Lightning JWildfire fractal and fixed it up as a transparent-edged vignette in Krita. It looks good. It looks good on the Dream page, too, but for some reason I'm not getting it resized in CSS correctly. I should shrink it in Krita anyway, but what's wrong with my CSS? Tomorrow's problem.
