I made fixes to the tables of contents in the Last Redoubt and Darkening story templates and the stories in those sections, and also the essays and essay templates. Also to the formatting for blockquotes in the Last Redoubt SCSS.
The fixes need to be copied to the poetry and vignettes template, whose table of contents for the individual work doesn't look those of the other story templates, and probably should. "Dream" is too short to need a TOC.
The blockquote formatting fix, and possibly some others, need to be copied from the Last Redoubt SCSS to Darkening and Last Redoubt Red.
