# Night Land Website

2025-10-25

My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

Fixed the positioning of the Galleries header image, and incidentally of the Logo on other pages. I started experimenting with using the figcaption to put the page title over the image, but I'm not sure I'm going to do it that way. It's presently yanked all the rest of the text on the page up, and that obviously must change.
