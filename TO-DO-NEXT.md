    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". I now have a helter-skelter version of Lightning, Black Lightning against deep crimson that looks like a war, looks like burning current.
    To Do:    
        Tomorrow I'll decide whether to stretch it out a little with CSS, as I used greater-separator and it's horizontally compressed a bit from the J-Wildfire rendering.
        If I'm still happy, I'll move the test code to the regular page. Then I'll clean up the mess I left in the image folders.
        I think "Dream" is looking good. I probably won't change any more standard colors.
