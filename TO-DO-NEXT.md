# Night Land Website

2025-07-23

    I linked Andy and Teoretisk's Night Wright pages on the Poetry and Vignettes subindex, and in "Dream". I made a preliminary layout of "Dream" with Teoretisk's illustrations.

    To Do Next:
        The preliminary layout uses <hr> for most breaks right now, because the existing Last Redoubt color scheme graphics are the wrong colors for this poem. They're blue-cool brown. The background is suitably black, but the decorations need to be whitish or reddish. So I need to do some graphics work next, to make suitable breaks.

        I wonder about color-shifting the Night Land violet flame header. That's not strictly necessary, but if it worked well enough, it might be interesting.
