    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". Almost there.
    To Do:    
       Clean up extraneous files. Rename the ones that are staying.
       Changing the color of the footer info and links doesn't work that well, so I'm letting the colors switch back to the standard Last Redoubt color scheme at the end.
       I also tried switching the top menu bar to red, but the whole thing looks better to me if it starts with the standard color scheme, switches into Red, White, Black, and then returns to the standard at the end.
       The nav bar links! I forgot them.
