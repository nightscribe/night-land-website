    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater".

    Experimenting with putting an oddly-vertebral lightning fractal partly behind the text, offset. Presently it's in normal position, but I may rotate it. If that works I may try something similar with Lightning-Black Lightning.
To Do:
    More image replacements for horizontal rules.
    Red lesser separator.
    Consider color shift for header and footer text.
    Clean up the mess of trial images in separators and illustrated-works.
