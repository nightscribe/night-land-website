    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". Made more separators and replaced some of the old ones. Experimenting with having the progression of images on the page fade from brighter electrics to the Teoretisk's near-black kill scene, Dying Bloody Eye, and Red Claw Fading to Black.

To Do:
    Lightning Black Lightning should be an unframed separator.
    Consider further rearrangement or replacement of separators.
    Consider color shift for header and footer text.
    Clean up the mess of trial images in separators and illustrated-works.
