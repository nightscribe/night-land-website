# Night Land Website

My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

I took a break from designing the Art Galleries index to transcribe "Salvage", a novella. I've broken it into parts. Part I is mostly ported.

To Do: pick a header image for part I. Clean up the stuff on the bottom. Part II. I need more Moving City and Darkening images, but I don't have time to produce them myself right now.
