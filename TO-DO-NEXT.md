# Night Land Website

2025-08-14
    Done:
        Started "Ex Machina". Adjusted the Darkening Story Template a bit. It probably needs more.
    To do:   
        Brett Davidson's Night Wrights page needs creating and linking.
        I haven't intended to finish any of the individual Night Wright pages yet, but the template for them is a bit muddled. The list styles are a mess. The longer it takes me to unmuddle it, the more pages I'll have to fix. I'll have to do a Night Wright page soon.
        Pick one of Brett's illustrations for the header illo.
        Add the rest of the story.
        Spell-check.
        Check links.
        Proofread.
        SCSS: fix the layout of lists in both the Darkening scheme, and if necessary the Last Redoubt scheme. The list of things to do presently at the top of the Darkening Story Template is awkward.
        Check existing works (which right row are "Eater" and "Red Twilight") and make sure the title and author metadata make sense. Also the H1 and H2 headers. Add the illustrator metadata to those to stories and "Ex Machina."
        Consider hue changes in some Darkening headers, for more visual interest.

        Major Design left:
            Gallery subindex. I'd like something more interesting than a bunch of rectangles, but I may not pull that off.
            Individual Gallery page.
            The Timeline. At least I know about what it's supposed to look like.
            Children of the Hive. I about know what that should look like, too -- Andy's -- but I need to replace a couple of non-Stephen Fabian images because I don't know where they came from.
            Andy had a third color scheme, for the non-fictional part of the site, but it had a light background. I'd like a third scheme too, but I don't want it to be dark-on-light because that'll force anybody who needs to adjust colors to do it twice. I haven't thought of a scheme yet. It's not absolutely necessary -- I could just use Last Redoubt -- and I'll probably get to this last.
