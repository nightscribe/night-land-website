# Night Land Website

The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So they also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

Can't link Night Wright artists gallery pages to their Night Wrights pages until I set up the gallery. Otherwise done so far: Andrea Bonazzi.

Fixed the centering problem.

To Do Next:
    I have started the Night Galleries index page design. I also need template pages for the indivdual artists. Sound/Multimedia and visual static artists might not get the same template.
    I need to make a different separator, or separators, for the Night Gallery index because the existing large separator doesn't suit Leung's illo.
