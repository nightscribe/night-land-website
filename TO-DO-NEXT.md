# Night Land Website

    Check "Dream" to see if any of the image links should be changed back to standard, since I'm now routinely using the red version of Tais Teng's header for the Darkening.

    Tables of contents now work correctly in the Last Redoubt scheme. The site-table-of-contents and work-table-of-contents changes need to be ported to the Darkening scheme and the Last Redoubt Red scheme, and corresponding changes made in the HTML.

    I also need to check the existing articles for markup that needs correction.
