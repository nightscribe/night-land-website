    The tables of contents on "Red Twilight" and "Ex Machina" are supposed to be centered. They're slightly to the right of every other thing that's supposed to centered. Did I make a mistake in the styling, or is this some idiotic CSS thing? If the latter I might not bother to fix it.

    I probably should do one of the long Last Redoubt stories next, to make any needed adjustments to that template.

    Then maybe either a gallery (if I can stand more design right now) or one of the essays.
