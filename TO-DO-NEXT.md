		The text separator images aren't contracting to match the screen width. Fix to match what's in the Darkening section, which does work.
        So far I have edited darkening.scss and last-redoubt.scss so the selectors match up visually, and almost all the differences are colors. This didn't make it obvious where the different behavior in the separator image contractions is coming from, so I have to check the HTML.
