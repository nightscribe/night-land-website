The last three parts of _Salvage_ need header illustrations, but I'm short darkening illos and don't have time to make them right now. I want to make some later. So they also don't have credits for such illos, either.

The same for "Narcissus".

To Do Next:
    Finish proofreading and link-checking "Red Giant's Race".
    Link check Andrea Bonazzi's Night Wright page and see if there's anything else I can do now. I won't be ready to add art gallery links until I finish setting up the galleries.
