My Rings and Wrought Iron fractal illo that I used for "A Sequel to the Time Machine?" doesn't blend well with the Last Redoubt color scheme. It either needs its color balance shifted cooler, or I need to use the Darkening theme for this essay, or I need a different image.

Fade-in version of Ray Leung's index page pic. I think it's OK. Needs lettering over (probably with CSS) and the rest of the page, which I don't know how I'm going to lay out yet.
