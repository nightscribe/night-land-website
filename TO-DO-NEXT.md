    I'm working on "Dream", a vignette reflecting on "Eater". Replaced some fractal separators and added some info.
To Do:
    Lightning Black Lightning should be an unframed separator.
    Consider further rearrangement or replacement of separators.
    Consider color shift for header and footer text.
    Clean up the mess of trial images in separators and illustrated-works.
    Fix the links. Some of them are broken.

    Also some of the "Eater" image links seem to be broken. Fix it.
