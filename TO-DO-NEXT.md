    Done:
        I picked "Ex Machina" as the first example long Darkening story.
        I decided the Darkening section titles and subtitles should be "The Darkening: Legends of the Last Long Sunset". I made the Darkening subindex, "Red Twilight", and the Darkening story template match.
        I fixed broken header and footer links in the Darkening story template, and made a bit more order out of it, but it still probably needs refinement.
    To do:   
        I think the Darkening section could benefit from more variety in subtitle colors, but I'll experiment with that later.
        Transfer "Ex Machina." I don't think it needs multiple pages. But "Across the Night Wall" and maybe some other long stories probably do.
