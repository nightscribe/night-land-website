            <h3>William Hope Hodgson's Fiction</h3>
            <h4>A Very Short Introduction</h4>
            <h5>by</h5>
            <h3>Kate Coady</h3>
            <p>British author William Hope Hodgson, the son of a minister, spent his part of early life at sea, though he did not remain there. He was killed in World War I.</p>
            <p>He wrote horror, occult detective stories, sea stories, science fiction, and poetry, among other things. His science fiction, horror, and occult detective stories have a unifying underlying cosmology.</p>
            <h4>Speculative Fiction</h4>
            <p>Mr. Hodgson's speculative fiction includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="book-title">The House on the Borderland</span> — A science fiction novel containing the fullest explication of his fictional cosmology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="book-title">The Night Land</span> — a voluminous work of science fiction about the far future, written in a pseudo-archaic style.
                </li>
                <li>Carnacki the Ghost-Finder stories — a series of short stories involving an occult detective.</li>
                <li>Sea horror stories of varying length, like <span class="book-title">The Boats of the Glen Carrig</span> and "A Voice in the Night."
                </li>
                <li>Assorted other horror stories.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reading Mr. Hodgson's Work</h4>
            <p>If you like H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood's "The Willows," or Robert W. Chambers' <i>The King in Yellow</i>, you might like Mr. Hodgson's speculative fiction.</p>
            <p>I recommend that you start with any of his sea horror stories, or <i>The House on the Borderland.</i> If you like those, you might like <i>The Night Land.</i></p>
            <p><i>The Night Land</i> is a strange, flawed, and brilliant book. My suggestions for reading it are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start it. If you can't abide the first chapter, skip to the second. Reading the first chapter gives a feeling of depth to the rest of the book. But the rest of the book can be read without it.</li>
                <li>If you like Mr. Hodgson's other works, but you can't stand <i>The Night Land's</i> presentation even after you get to the second chapter, try James Stoddard's <i>The Night Land: A Story Retold.</i> This modernizes the language and approach, while keeping to the original story. The cost of modernization is that you lose the atmosphere created by Mr. Hodgson's odd pseudo-archaic language.
                </li>
            </ol>
