                <p>A bleak and timeworn beauty lingered in the rock-strewn waste of the eastern Bight, and Astren, as she hiked through it, took pleasure in its melancholy grandeur. Around her in the distance towered the Walls of the World — the massive black cliffs of staggering height that enclosed the L-shaped Great Valley. An immense canyon opened westward through the Walls; and through the gap she could see the dying sun, a motionless disk of sullen ochre that smoldered in the tawny sky. It cast a feeble ruddy light across the chill and desolation round about her.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, she'd travelled out from the City by the Lake of Bronze to add to the cache of supplies she was accumulating in the barrens; and at that time, she'd heard the scurrying of small animals concealed amongst the patchy vegetation, and the squawking of a flock of anteliornis on the Lake. But now, as she returned to the City, all seemed unnaturally quiet. A breathless stillness had spread across the land, as if it lay drowned beneath a tide of silence. The shards of dead coral crunched into the friable soil beneath her boots; but nothing else, save her own breathing, seemed to stir.</p>
                <p><i>What's happening? If something's out here hunting, I should feel it, </i>she thought. But the aether itself seemed hushed. To the south she could see the pale glow of the City's lights; but she couldn't sense the telempathic noise invariably produced by the minds of its fifty-eight thousand inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Her brows knit, and she halted and turned, to scan her surroundings. A furlong to the northwest, a low-lying pool of fog marked the position of a magma-warmed spring; beyond it, far off, she could see smoke from a range of volcanoes curling skyward. To the north, many leagues away, a second huge opening gaped in the Walls of the World; and she eyed it warily. But she spied nothing noteworthy on the northern barrens, either with her unaided eyes or with binoculars. When she turned eastward, she could see the glare of a lava lake reflected dully against the foot of the gargantuan red-black cliffs; but again she detected nothing that could have produced the uncanny calm.</p>
                <p><i>Peculiar. — Could the Heritage have invented some sort of an aetheric damper? </i> She frowned. The basic research she'd seen published suggested that no human or perihuman power was close to creating such a device. Nor was the Federation for the Furtherance of the Heritage of Humankind well equipped to pursue aetheric research — they so distrusted anyone who might be able to make contact with the bizarre and deadly Outsiders that they routinely killed all the communers in the cities they controlled. But what else could produce such an effect?</p>
                <p><i>For once, I'll be glad to back inside the City walls, </i>she thought as she set off again, quickening her pace.</p>
                <p>Soon the coral scrub ended, its old southern reaches buried beneath a millennium-old lava plain. She started to cross the plain, stepping carefully over its ropy black pahoehoe formations . And she stopped, suddenly.</p>
                <p>She felt an evanescent contact in the aether — the touch of another mind, subtle as the brush of a single strand of spider's silk.</p>
                <p>Her spine prickled, and she slipped her plasma lance out of its holster. Only another communer could have impinged upon her mind in quite that fashion — and not many human communers were left in the Great Valley, now that the Heritage controlled every city but her own.</p>
                <p>Her lips compressed and her knuckles white, she stood motionless, listening.</p>
                <p>Nothing disturbed the aether, and finally Astren began walking again. But she didn't, immediately, sheathe the lance. Ever since the Unforgivable Experiments had breached the Earth's defenses and allowed the bizarre and ominous entities of the Outer Circle to invade, the inhabitants of the Great Valley had had worse to fear than beasts, other humans, or their near-human kindred. Too many of the Outsiders were pneumavores — psychic predators and parasites.</p>
                <p>They had found human psyches rich enough to feed upon, and scarcely adapted to resist them.</p>
