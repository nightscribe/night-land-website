                <h4>Catharsis</h4>
                <h5>... by Nigel Brown</h5>
                <p>After a hundred thousand years, it was time to clear out these Levels of the Long Siege — the lowest half-mile of the Pyramid that had borne the greatest brunt of attacks from the Night Land ... I quickened my pace, but my heart began to thump for another reason: What if he wasn’t here? What if I was too late?</p>

                <h4>Lute</h4>
                <h5>... by Don Webb</h5>
                <p>The People gave me an ugly human name — Lute. I am very ugly, for I am the product of twelve generations of breeding made to pass for human.</p>

                <h4>An Exhalation of Butterflies</h4>
                <h5>... by Nigel Atkinson</h5>
                <p>The sound of a great gong echoed down the hourducts. Everyone froze in surprise. There was at least a thirdhour until the next scheduled sending, and they were not usually announced so clamourously. Clearly something was up.</p>

                <h4>Imago</h4>
                <h5>... by Brett Davidson</h5>
                <p>She did not fully understand it yet, but she had a very peculiar talent that could indeed change her as the butterflies were changed: she was a liar.</p>

                <h5>A novella by <a href="night-wrights/nigel-atkinson.html">Nigel Atkinson</a></h5>
                <p>The Master Monstruwacan-designate leaned forward and looked down at the broken land. In the eternal gloom it was difficult to make out details, but things were moving amid the rubble &mdash; and the children were gone.</p>

                <h4>The Last Redoubt</h4>
                <h5 class="subtitle">Being the second chapter of <i>The Night Land</i></h5>
                <h5>by William Hope Hodgson</h5>
                <p> To me, in this last time of my visions, of which I would tell, it was not as if I <i>dreamed;</i> but, as it were, that I <i>waked</i> there into the dark, <i>in the future of this world.</i> And the sun had died; and for me thus newly waked into that Future, to look back upon this, our Present Age, was to look back into dreams that my soul knew to be of reality; but whichto those newly-seeing eyes of mine, appeared but as a far vision, strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light.</p>

                <h4>The Voice of the Lacuna</h4>
                <h5>A short story by Gerard Houarner</h5>

                <h4>The Seeker</h4>
                <h5>... by Carole Carmen</h5>
                <p>In recent years, a tall figure in shattered grey armour has been seen wandering the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk. It is not known if this is a True Human — scholars continue to debate. But he has become known to all as The Seeker.</p>
                <img class="lesser-separator" src="media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
                <h4>Meanwhile, She Dreams</h4>
                <h5>... by Brett Davidson</h5>
                <p>What would it be like to be outside? she wonders, flirting with the evil thought. She is half-sick of shadows of real darkness. What was it like Out in the Night Land? ...As if in response, she hears what could almost be the wind whistling about the walls of the Redoubt, but the outer walls are over a mile away in every direction.</p>
                <img class="lesser-separator" src="media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
                <h4>The Guild of the Last Migration</h4>
                <h5>... by Welleran</h5>
                <p>Dressed all in black as we are, and hooded, it is easy to dismiss sightings of our activities as the actions of strange new monsters. Still, secrecy is the First Stricture, and enforced on pain of death. &mdash; So much secrecy. </p>

                <h4>Noise</h4>
                <h5>... by Elizabeth Counihan</h5>
                <p>"I have heard that your citizens can help people with — unusual requests." I saw her hands clench, too late to conceal their trembling.</p>
                <img class="lesser-separator" src="media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
                <h4>Slope</h4>
                <h5>... by Andy Robertson</h5>
                <p>It is Forbidden to look back, but he has seen. There are six great gaps in the view of the Land, in the sensorium of the Helm, where the things too terrible to be viewed must exist, for the Helm does not permit him to see any thing there.</p>

                <h4>Kiss: The Heresy of Scyrr, Part II</h4>
                <h5>... by Andy Robertson</h5>
                <p>To the strange lights and the dark gaps in the air; to the black gardens of the Eaters; to the icy wastes; to the troll-kin and the beasts; to the unknown and ever-changing Night Land, two Hundreds went Out. Seventeen returned.</p>

                <h4>Marks: The Heresy of Scyrr, Part III</h4>
                <h5>... by Andy Robertson</h5>
                <p>She appeared without announcement or escort and She came up to us. Everyone was looking, hardly believing: you could trace Her walk through the sparse crowds by the heads that turned and the people that changed their path, or bowed and curtseyed, or drew back in fear.</p>
                <img class="lesser-separator" src="media/images/separators/coady--lesser-separator-aqua-sand-current-needle.webp"/>
                <h4>The Inward Seer</h4>
                <h5>A Short Story by Mark Valentine</h5>

                <h5>... by Brett Davidson</h5>
                <p>The news came to Aver that the Master Monstruwacan was embarking upon an expedition Outside to investigate the antithesis of the Last Redoubt itself: the Great Watching Thing of the South. The Watcher had fascinated the population of the Redoubt for almost its entire existence — and it was surely according to its own mysterious needs fascinated by the Redoubt.</p>

                <p>When the Kronologers announced that the number of years until the final failure of the Earth Current and destruction of the Great Redoubt (though not yet of all human life) had dropped under one million, the great furor that some had suspected might ensue did not happen.</p>
