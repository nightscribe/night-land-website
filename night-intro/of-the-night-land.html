                <h3>Of the Night Land ...</h3>
                <h5>The Sun has died.</h5>
                <p>Not a planet, not a star, shines in the black heavens.</p>
                <p>The Days of Light are less than a legend, their stories mouldered to dust amid the chaos of the ancient Libraries.</p>
                <p>Yet, within their vast arcology, the last Millions of humanity live and thrive.</p>
                <img class="bordered" src="../media/images/headers/fabian--watcher-of-the-south.jpg" alt="A huge monster in a dark land, whose way is blocked by a glowing dome of bright light. The Watcher of the South, by Stephen Fabian."/>
                <p>Outside, the huge entities of the Night Land watch — and wait.</p>
                <p>The Last Redoubt has stood ten million years, and may stand ten million years more, but its final fall is inevitable.</p>
                <p>The Land is as unknown as the depths of space. It holds life, some of it remotely akin to humanity. Fires burn and and shadows creep; cities and lights lie still; clothed and shrouded walkers glide forth.</p>
                <p>Other Creatures, vaster than hills and slower and more ponderous than glaciers, wait eternally.</p>
                <p>Forces stir in the darkness. Messages pass across the Land. From the tower above the Redoubt, the Monstruwacans keep record.</p>
                <img class="bordered" src="../media/images/headers/humphries--attack-of-the-abhumans.jpg" alt="An armored man with a gleaming wheeled blade weapon trying to fight off three huge apeman-like attackers, in a dark land, near a fire. Attack of the Abhumans, by Jeremiah Humphries."/>
                <p>To this Land go the explorers of the Redoubt.</p>
                <p>Rarely, rarely, they return.</p>
