                <p>Astonishingly enough &mdash; since the World Wide Web is roughly three and a half decades old as I'm writing this &mdash; until recently, Web browsers had no good way to let a reader set a bookmark in an arbitrary location on a page. Bookmarking within a page is obviously necessary if browsers are to be much good for reading long Web documents that don't have many natural breaks: and yet this function was long missing. (There was a short-lived exception: that browser would once, as standard procedure, save your place on a page; but, oddly, they got rid of this capability after they had it.)</p>
                <p>This gap in function left any website with long-form texts with the choice of putting bookmarkable breaks in the text where none are natural, or of breaking the texts up into smaller files. Both are a confounded nuisance.</p>
                <p>They're enough of a nuisance that I'd decided it would be less trouble to write some Javascript to allow the reader to set in-page bookmarks anywhere ... when I discovered that the capability now exists in Chrome- and Firefox-based browsers (and also in Edge and Safari). I hadn't found out about the new capability because it rejoices in the unforeseeable name "text fragments".</p>
                <p>In Chrome-based browsers, you can now set bookmarks at arbitrary places on a Web page by selecting the text you want to refer to, and right-clicking. You will see, among other options, "Copy Link to Highlight". If you click on "Copy Link to Highlight", then open a new tab and paste, you'll get the address of the text you highlighted. You can bookmark that new tab, and you'll have a bookmark to the text in question, and hence to where you stopped reading (if that's why you're bookmarking there).</p>
                <p>[[ Here goes a link to 'Van Allen Belts' in "Sharks of the Aether". But I have to make a blank for the essay first.]]</p>
                <p>To create text fragment links in Firefox-based browsers, you need to install an extension called Link to Text Fragment. Once you do that, it works the same way: you select some text you want to come back to, and right click. The option to create a reference to it is called "Copy Link to Selected Text". Paste that into a new tab and you can bookmark it.</p>
                <p>This ability to bookmark arbitrary text is apparently a World Wide Web Consortium initiative rather than a creation of the browser-makers, so I expect it to stick around, even if it's been badly publicized to date.</p>
                <p>Of course, I'm telling you about it because you can now use it to set bookmarks in our longer stories and essays anywhere you please. And I don't have to write Javascript.</p>
