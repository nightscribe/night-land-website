                <p>We cannot measure the Great Valley&apos;s depth. And the strange thing is that our surveys tell us that this canyon is older than the Cataclysm. I think it lay under the earth, waiting to be revealed. What lies in its depths, I wonder?</p>

                <p>A breathless stillness had spread across the land, as if it lay drowned beneath a tide of silence. The shards of dead coral crunched into the friable soil beneath her boots; but nothing else, save her own breathing, seemed to stir.</p>
                <p><i>What&apos;s happening? If something&apos;s out here hunting, I should feel it.</i></p>

                <p>Seditiously hidden behind the conventional crest of my division on my silver gorget, there was a cameo gem carved with an emblem of Astrarchê Io. When I was sure of my privacy, I would take it out and look at it, wondering.</p>
